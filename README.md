Do you constantly get this annoying error?
```

It whines at you, "Please try running this command again as root/Administrator." So you
constantly have to run your node commands as 'sudo' and plug in your password. Sucks
right?

There could be a permissions problem on your ~/.npm directory. For users who don't know
what'~' means, it's a shorthand for /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/ (the 'home' directory) where
the first '/' is your root directory. Full path to your '~/.npm' directory is
'/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.npm'; it stores various npm functionality. The easiest way to
get to your home directory on a unix based system is to type 'cd'. This goes to home.

There could also a permissions problem on your /usr/local/lib/node_modules. This is where
npm tries to store your globally installed modules. It is the system level version of
the 'node_modules' folder you find in basically any project you make and install
with dependencies.

Usage - Solve Yo Problems, AKA intro was TLDR
=================
Run:
```
sudo fixmynode
Password:TYPE_YOUR_PASSWORD
```
That's it. You're done, that will fix the two permissions problems above and from now on out you should be able to use:
```
npm install SOME_MODULE
//or
npm install -g SOME_MODULE
```
without having to type in 'sudo' your password everytime.

The Future
==========
Maybe someone who knows how to work one of the machines called "Windows" can fork me?
I doubt this works on a windows system as is, since /bin is probably somewhere else.
